* Terminal colors for Bubble Gum, Midnight, Nature
* Revisit borderSoft/Medium/Hard to maybe only have 1 or 2 types?
* Maybe _only_ use bold fonts for reserved things? Feels heavy at times
  * A lot of the TextMate-ish rules are too broad and need to be reigned in
  * Maybe I can just refactor that area heavily since it's pretty thick and
    confusing right now as it is
